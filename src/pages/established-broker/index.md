##### Stage 1: Start Up
It’s frantic, you typically chase everything to survive
##### Stage 2: Established
You pause, you’ve got a business, now you need to recruit some help or move to Maintain
##### Stage 3: Growth
The most difficult stage - You achieve double digit organic income growth year after year
##### Stage 4: Maintain
A business that funds a lifestyle. It feels comfortable and cosy
##### Stage 4: Prepare
The most important stage that most do not do. Getting the business ready for ‘The Event’
##### Stage 4: The Event
