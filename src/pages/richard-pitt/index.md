## Who is Richard Pitt?
I am a qualified farm manager, who realised from an early age that being paid one cow a month was not going to pay the bills. I re-trained, re-qualified and wrote over 70 speculative letters to get my first Insurance job. 

Having worked for one of the most dynamic and entrepreneurial Insurers in the market, I switched my attention to broking. I have set up one brokerage from scratch and run a large SME broker in the South West.

I have done almost every job in the Insurance marketplace, including running a £70m MGA. That experience qualified me to help the largest network of regional independent brokers to re-establish itself as a market leader. 

I am an avid skier who always thought that boarding looked more fun but never had the skill to master it. I love playing golf, fly fishing, cycling, tennis and walking the dog with my family.
