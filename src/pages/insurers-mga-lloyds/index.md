The regional independent broker community represents an under realised opportunity for many Insurers, MGA’s and Lloyds syndicates. As a group, this broker community holds significant amounts of highly attractive, loyal and profitable businesses that many Insurers, MGA’s and Lloyds syndicates are seeking.

The trouble is that the two communities often talk a completely different language, one talks about premium, rating strength and loss ratios and the other talks about improving customer outcomes, service and income.

Critical Friend Partnership has the knowledge, insight and understanding of how the Insurance marketplace can talk the same language as the Broker community and be rewarded by significant profitable growth. It does not need to take a lot to stand out from the crowd, the opportunity exists for anyone that is brave enough to take the necessary steps.

Uniquely, Critical Friend Partnership is able to operate as both a Non-Exec to your business and an exclusive consultancy service that can assist in unlocking this highly attractive, difficult to reach, sector of the marketplace.
